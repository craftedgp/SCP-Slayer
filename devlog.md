# CraftedGP's diary for this project
[2024-08-17]
Holy shit, I actually made it this far, last time I tried making a game in Ursina didn't go well, my dad didn't like the idea and get de-motivationg me so I gave up, never touched Ursina for 2 years, until one day. I'm like "man, I like SCP games so much, I really should make an SCP game of my own, but idk how to use any game engines other than Ursina because my dad forced to only learn Python(fuck you, dad) so I have no choice but to make it in Ursina", and so it begins.
I first Wanted to make an SCP-087-B but after a while I was overwhelmed by the mechanics of the game so I came up with another idea, "What if I made an SCP game where you explore every SCP's mechanic without reading the wiki, yeah that seems like a good idea, I'll start with SCP-096.". I honestly didn't believe that I could make SCP-096 in Python but here we are, I just made SCP-096 and I'm onto other mechanics of the game, good start.
After SCP-096 huge messy main.py file I thought to myself "No no no, I can't just fit an entire game full of fucntions, classes, methods into one big file. That'll be a pain in the ass to work with for sure." So I had no choice but to split main.py into multiple files, so I came up with a decent file structures for the project, which is the one you currently see.
I started splitting main.py harder than my parents splitting away from each other after divorce. At first I didn't know calling main from another file and another file from main could cause such a huge problem (circular import), so I had to **lock in**. A day or two passed by, and I managed to succeed in splitting main.py into multiple other files than I can import later. Anyways, next thing I need to do is make a Respawn mechanic because, trust me, dying to SCP-096 in a blank baseplate in a amature game dev's game can be really boring, so I'm going to add a map too.
Alright, I'm kinda tired so I'll head to head to sleep, or maybe play something idk bye cya
