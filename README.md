# SCP SIMULATOR Beta v0.9
The SCP Simulator is a game where you explore various SCP Subjects without having to read the SCPwiki, the game is 3D and multiplayer
## Developer note
This game is still in it's early stages, so far we only have :
- SCP 096 (and not fully finished 90% done)

> Next thing on my to-do list for this game is to split main.py into multiple python files, I've tried this before and it didn't go well. This game can't just be one big file, there's gotta be a way

-craftedgp, 5 mins before falling asleep
## How to play in early stages
First you need Python version 3.11 at least

After that you need the [Ursina Game Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) installed, to do that use the pip install manager that comes with Python.
```bash
pip install ursina
```
Once finished, double click on main.py and please give us feedback for any bugs or errors
